# 3D Printers
Here are all the files for my 3d printers: configs, modifications, firmwares, etc. that I have done to the 3D printers I own/have owned.
Also there's a dump of my cura installation, with machine settings and everything in ./cura. This should be able to be dropped in any machine.

## Anet A8
My 3D printer, has a long story which is briefly explained in the dedicated file. Arrived without the extruder mount, has been severly modded and after almost an year and a half of owning it and working on it from time to time, I have a setup that satisfies me and makes the printer reliable

## Creality Ender 3
My dad's 3d printer, worked wonders stock and out of the box for him, but he printed some nice-to-have accessories, which are in the dedicated folder.

## Miracube LC
Custom-Designed by a friend of ours (me and my father), in 2015 or thereabout (back when 3d printers were rare to have) and custom-built back when we used to go in a FabLab near our house. The history of the building of this machine can be found on [my dad's website](http://www.radioedintorni.it/FabLab/FabLab-index.html) (although it's only in italian)<br>
I do not own this machine anymore, it was given to another friend of ours, but it suffered of a lot of problems which probably required an over-haul of a lot of parts. I learned a lot using and fixing this printer, it's a secret dream of mine to get it to finally print reliably. Files can be found in the dedicated folder and on the [thingiverse post](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:748548)
