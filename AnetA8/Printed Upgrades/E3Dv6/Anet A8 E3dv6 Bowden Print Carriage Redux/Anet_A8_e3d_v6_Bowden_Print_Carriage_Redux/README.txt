# Summary

This is a combine work project between myself and [Dan Rogers](http://www.thingiverse.com/knotbeerdan/about). The purpose was to create a print head mount that allows the user some customization to their exact/ or wanted setup **This is for a Bowden setup**. There are 4 variations of the mount: 

               -Sensor with cooling fan
               -Sensor without cooling fan
               -No sensor with cooling fan
               -No sensor without cooling fan 

Many of the parts are interchangeable if you wish to make changes down the road as you upgrade/ change you own setup. 

There is some required materials for assembly and they are as follows:

          - M3 Hex nut: 8 pieces
          - M3 Screw 25mm length: 7 pieces
          - M3 screw 20mm length: 1 piece
          - The 12 existing screws used to mount the existing carriage to the axis
    
You can use standard screws or socket head screws

**Printing**

You will want to use some supports when printing the PRINT CARRIAGE PLATE and the HEAD LOCK. **DONT** use supports when printing the cooling fan duct. 

See the images for the recommended part orientations when printing.

**Assembly**

Prior to assembly, you will want to press fit four (4) M3 hex nuts into the carriage plate, two (2) into the head lock ( the two slots along the top, confirm they align with the screw holes) and 1 into the fan mount (again confirm they align with the screw hole) 

Step 1: Attach the belt holder to the back of the carriage plate ( be sure the opening is facing down) Use four (4) M3x25 screws to do this.

Step 2: Attach the print carriage to the bearings on the X axis. Using the existing 12 screws. It is recommended using the cross tightening method. Then once all screws are in tighten them all down

Step 3: Place the e3d v6 into its opening on the print carriage and attach the desired head lock (fan or no fan). Using two (2) M3x25mm screws **This will be a snug fit** 

At this point if you are not using a sensor or the fan your carriage is completed

Step 4: Attach the turbo fan (5015- radial cooling fan) using one (1) M3x20 screw on the upper most hole and one (1) m3x25 screw on the lower hole

Step 5: Attach the cooling ring to the turbo fan

At this point if you are not using a leveling sensor your carriage is completed 

Step 6: Attach your leveling sensor (proximity or inductive) to the mount using the included hardware with the purchase of one. 

**FINAL STEP FOR EVERY VARIATION**
Secure your wires with a zip tie through the slots on the side of the print carriage. This is HIGHLY recommended as stress relief.

**Sensor**
This thing is designed for an 18mm sensor or a 12mm sensor. So when choosing your print carriage, be sure to select WHICH file you want. 

**Sensor offsets**
With this design the offset of the center of the sensor to the center of the nozzle is: 

               **-28.873mm**


Please post make pictures if you print and use this print head!
 
**EDIT 2/15/2016**
                 
The Co-designer [Dan Rogers](http://www.thingiverse.com/knotbeerdan/about/) has released a new cooling fan duct that works along with this print head at the following link. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2086437 . The goal was to create a lower profile cooling duct.
